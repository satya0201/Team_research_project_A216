Students deal with various habits and routines that can influence how well they perform in their studies. One of these habits is weekend alcohol consumption, which might affect their focus, energy and consistency when it comes to academics. Using the student dataset, this study looks at whether the amount of alcohol a student drinks on weekends has any connection to their final grade. The goal is simply to see if higher weekend drinking levels relate to lower academic performance or if there is no real link between the two.
